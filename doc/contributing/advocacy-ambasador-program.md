# Advocacy Ambassador program

The project aims to support and encourage developers and developer
advocates to promote Node.js as a project and to help communicate
key messages to their constituencies.

The ambassador program does that by:

* Maintaining an up to date set of messages that it would like abassadors
  to promote. These will be documented in the nodejs/ambassadors repository.
* Maintaining an up to date set of topics on which additional content
  would benefit the community. These will be documented in the
  nodejs/ambassadors repository.
* Providing a space for collaborators to share new topics/features they
  are working on, when they would be happy for ambassadors to help share and get
  early feedback.
* Helping ambassadors promote content that aligns with the
  messages and topics defined through social media and other channels.
* Advocating for ambasadors to be part of the OpenJS speakers bureau, even if the
  ambassador is not otherwise and active member of the project itself.

## Abassadors nominations

Any member of the Node.js organization may nominate an ambassador.
The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) will review/approve ambassadors.

In the initial phase of the program:

* there will be a maximum of 4 ambassadors
* the term will be for the calendar year. After a year ambassadors automatically
  drop out of the ambassador list and must be re-nominated
* ambassadors will be documented on the nodejs/ambassadors README.md

The TSC may chose to remove an ambassador if things are not working
out in terms of the content promoted and alignment with the project.

Members of the Node.js organization can nominate ambasssadors by opening
an issue in: TBD.

## Reviewing content

Ambassadors are asked to share links to new content before asking
for the content to be promoted. The goal is to provide the opportunity
for collaborators to help improve content as opposed to a detailed
nitpick review.

This is done by opening an issue in the nodejs/ambassadors
repository on which access is limited to members of the Node.js
organization. The issue may include the link to existing published
content or a draft of the content itself.

Interested members of the Node.js organization may comment/make
suggestions in the issue and the ambassadors are expected to
consider those suggestions and update the content when they feel it
is appropriate.

Explicit approval is not required in the issue (ie if there is zero
input that's ok), but objections should addressed before
requesting promotion.

## Promoting content

We trust ambassadors to only request promotion of content that lines
up with the messages and topics outlined, that this content does not overly
market their employer or product/business, and that they have followed the review
process. An abassador can request promotion of content in the following ways:

* Requesting that a tweet be retweeted by the Node.js twitter account.
* Requesting that a linkedin in post be reposted by the Node.js linkedin
  account.
* At mentioning the nodejs/ambassadors team to ask other ambassadors to
  repost
* Posting a link to the content in the "what's new" issue in nodejs/ambassadors
  so that it goes out on the news feed.

Requests for a retweet or Linkedin repost will be done by the foundation
staff without any need for validation based on the request coming from
an ambassador. These requests can be made through the existing social channel
in the OpenJS slack. For that reason and for communication purposes and
collaboration opportunities ambassadors should be a member of the
[OpenJS slack](https://slack-invite.openjsf.org/)
